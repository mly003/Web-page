                <p>The information on this site will be concerned with a cross-disciplinary 
                    field of condensed matter physics. Specifically, the unification of the 
                    quantum mechanics of light-matter interactions together with the quantum field 
                    theory of strongly correlated condensed matter systems. In the following, a brief
                    exposition of the two will be given, before we delve into the 
                    theoretical description.
                  </p>
              <h2>Strongly Correlated Electron Systems</h2>
              <p>At the most basic level, a solid state material can be described in terms
                of electrons roaming around in a static crystal lattice constituting positively
                charged atomic cores. From the electron systems vantage point, there are two 
                forms of energy dictating the dynamics of the system. The first contribution is
                the kinetic energy contribution of each electron, and the other one is that from the 
                pairwise electrostatic potential energy of the electrons. 
              </p>
              <p>For starters, it is the kinetic energy that induces motion electron motion in 
                the crystal lattice. In terms of the electrons momentum, p, the kinetic energy is given 
                by $$E_k={p^2 \over 2m}$$, where m is the electrons mass. Due to the nature of the coulombic force between two electrons,
                the system will have its energy raised whenever pairs of electrons are brought 
                closely together. The potential energy (in our units) is simply$$E_p = { 1 \over r}.$$ , where 
                r is the distance between the two electrons.
              </p>
              <p>At this point, we are in a position to at least make some charicative 
                descriptions of different condensed matter systems. To this end, we define 
                the ratio of the above quantities, \( \rho={ E_k \over E_p }\). For a system
                with \(\rho \approx 0\) the electrons are spatially localized. Note that \(\rho \approx 0\)
                would permit the kinetic energy contribution to be non-vanishing. However, the
                dominating potential energy would effectively lock the electrons in place. 
                The opposite case of \(\rho =\infty\) describes a system comprised of 
                independendent electrons travelling around in the crystal lattice unimpeded
                by other electrons. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The described domains of \(\rho= \infty,0\) each belong to simple systems. 
                The independent electron description in the case of \(\rho = \infty\) 
                enables us to ask meaningful questions about single electron properties
                like; an electrons energy or momentum without any reference to the other
                electrons in the system. Where \(\rho \approx 0\), requires a bit more theoretical
                machinery, but eventually reduces to an equally trivial description as the 
                \(\rho =\infty \) case. One way to make it apparent, is to introduce a 
                simplified form of the potential energy, 
                $$E_p \approx \theta( {1\over r} -{1 \over a}) {1\over r+c}$$ where \(\theta\) is 
                the heaviside step function, a is the lattice site separation, and c is what
                is referred to as a "softening parameter" - introduced to remove the infinite
                energy at \(r=0\). (here only in an ad hoc way) If we now imagine the 3D crystal lattice to be partioned
                into cells/cubes of side lengths a, we can envisage that some cells will
                have one or more electrons, whereas some cells will have none. Since there is
                no kinetic energy, the electrons stay still at all times and 
                the matter of calculating the total energy of the system is simply done by
                counting up the number of electrons in each cell and prescribing to each cell 
                an energy according to the formula above - see figure 1. What then about single electron energies?
                Since the Hamiltonian (the expression for the total energy of the system) incorporates
                only two-body interactions, attributing one electron a given energy is at the face of it
                not a meaningful question. However, experimental techniques like ARPES (Angle 
                Resolved Photo-emission Spectroscopy) probe exactly these energies. To establish
                the correspondence between theory and this experimental technique, we must in 
                due time explore the theory of Green's functions. As for now, we settle this 
                example by noting that we can in fact attribute single particle energies to even 
                the system described by \( \rho=0\).

              <p>The pieces missing are all the other values of \(\rho\) between 0 and \(\infty\). 
                It turns out that this landscape offers rich physics like exotic quantum
                mechanical phase transitions. At the same time, it admits mostly
                highly non-trivial theoretical descriptions. (which only adds to the excitement)
                Now, given the trivial nature of both regimes layed out above, what is so 
                challenging about this new intermediate regime? Unlike the above description, 
                which could be understood in classical terms, the intermediate regime is only
                aptly described by quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, we will attempt to describe it only
                in terms of elementary quantum mechanics.
              </p>
              <p>
                The quantum mechanical state of a system is always expressed in a particular basis.
                We are free to choose this basis, but we are at the same time guided by
                the particularity of the physical system we are trying to describe. In the hydrogen
                atom, the attractive interaction between electron and nucleus offers an apt 
                description of the system in terms of basis functions that are localized in 
                the vicinity of the nucleus. For a (semi-)free electron, a basis of
                plane waves is the obvious choice. Roughly speaking, the various bases can be 
                partitioned into categories of localized bases and de-localized ones.
                The difficulty of performing a quantum mechanical simulation really boils down
                to how many basis elements we require in order to adequately represent
                the quantum system. Keep in mind the following correspondence
                <ul>
                  <li>Bound electrons \(\leftarrow\rightarrow\) Localized basis</li>
                  <li>Free electrons \(\leftarrow\rightarrow\) de-localized basis</li>
                </ul>
                Now, any intermediate regime between bound and free is usually described by either 
                one of the two. Furthermore, the farther the system is separated from the 
                "Bound electron" or the "Free electron" ideals, the more basis functions are needed. 
                This is the crux of the problem of strongly correlated electron systems.
                Computational complexity increases drastically both with respect to the 
                number of electrons included in the system, and the departure from any of 
                the listed ideal systems. In fact, this limitation is so severe that 
                theoretical condensed matter physics is only concerned with simplified 
                models like the Hubbard model, Heisenberg model or the Falicov-Kimball model. 
                These models usually employ a static lattice approximation, and full
                numerical treatment is restricted to low dimension. (1D is the most studied)
                Without exploiting symmetries or other simplifying assumptions on top of the
                Hubbard model for instance, the number of basis functions scales as \(4^N\) 
                where N is the number of sites in the crystal lattice. On the most powerful
                computers, system sizes over \(N=30\) is hardly ever attainable. (And especially
                not for time-dependent systems)
